# Get All Letter Combinations

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that the digit, 1, does not map to any letters.

```
1         2         3
          ABC       DEF

4         5         6
GHI       JKL       MNO

7         8         9
PQRS      TUV       WXYZ
```

Examples:

- Input: `"23"`

  Output: `["AD", "AE", "AF", "BD", "BE", "BF", "CD", "CE", "CF"]`

- Input: `"234"`

  Output: `["ADG", "ADH", "ADI", "AEG", "AEH", "AEI",...]`
