# Tree Search

There are a couple of ways to search a tree: breadth-first search and depth-first search.

## Breadth-first Search

Breadth-first search is an algortihm that searches all nodes in a tree by each depth.

## Depth-first Search

Depth-first search is an algorithm that searches the depths of each node before backtracking.
