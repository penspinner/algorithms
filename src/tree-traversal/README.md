# Tree Traversal

Trees can be traversed in several ways: in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal.

## In-order Traversal

For in-order traversal, traverse from the left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.

## Pre-order Traversal

For pre-order traversal, traverse from the root to the left subtree then to the right subtree.

## Post-order Traversal

For post-order traversal, traverse from the left subtree to the right subtree then to the root.
