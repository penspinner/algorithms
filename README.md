# Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to a bunch of algorithmic problems I've tackled. The origin of the problems range from places like LeetCode, HackerRank, and interview problems I've been given.

## Scripts

### Scaffold

Run the `scaffold` script to generate some empty files for the new algorithm:

```bash
bun scaffold.ts newalgorithname
```
